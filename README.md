#Automatic Tagging of Code-Mixed Data (English-Hindi Code Mixed Data)

Word level identification of code mixed data
  This project was made with the aim to tackle to improve processing time of transliterated data, once these worlds are  successfullt tagged we only need	 to access monolingual documents to  process theses	code-mixed  queries.
What is code mixed data?

Due to the freedom that social media provides deviations in the data on these sites occur due to switching between two languages.Code-mixed text adopts the vocabulary and grammar of two or more languages and often	forms new structures based on its users.

The project does the following:
  1. World Level Identification - Where each word is assigned a  language tag from either of EN  (English), HI (Hindi), UN (Universal),  EMT (Emoticon).
  2. Calculating a Borrowedness Index - A	metric system to evaluate blending in the data corpus.
      Example	- match	dekhna	 (to	see the	match).	The English word	“match” in this case is an example	of borrowing.
  3. Models used - 
      a. Dictionary Based
      b. Support Vector Machine
      c. Conditional Random Fields
